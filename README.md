# SimpleService
A simple F# service that shows how you can do a like-for-like replacement of C# to F# and use the standard OWIN / web api stuff.

This is a super simple service that takes a text file of items and users that have access to them (lines in the form of item:user,user,user)
and allows the data to be consumed by a simple web api. Nothing fancy.

The aim of this project is to show that you can use F# with all of the standard C# libraries / ways of doing things.
